# UMD_DataChallenge2019

I participated UMD's 1-week data challenge with a team of 3 other students (Linda, Grace & Ruthwick). This repository consists of the jupyter notebooks I used to clean the data, transform the data into forms that we more usefull and perform EDA to answer our research questions. We did a combination of temporal and spatial analysis to make recommendations to Zagster on how to improve their bike-share service. Using our analysis and the 1/4 mile standard (urban planning standard), we came up with three new locations for stations. 



The tools I used were:
⋅⋅* Jupyter Notebooks (Python)
⋅⋅* Pandas
⋅⋅* Seaborn
⋅⋅* Folium

### City of College Park mBike Bikeshare Dataset
"Data is from 6/14/2017 to 1/14/2019 and contains 1,851,924 rows. Generally speaking, the bikeshare dataset contains fields for GPS coordinates, Trip ID, Events (i.e. Docking/Undocking/Pausing), User ID, Date and Time. Bikeshare data analysis could help us locate new bikeshare stations based on current usage patterns or figure out what months/days/times are most popular. Data visualization would help with these questions. The students could even go much further to overlay GIS terrain info and make a model that predicts how much rebalancing a new station at the top of a hill might need based on elevation. This could be based on existing trip data for the number of trips that “start at” versus the number “that end at” higher elevations. Or, students could combine our data with historic weather data to see how much weather conditions affect ridership. We’re open to any insights that the students can discover." - Provided by mBike for the challenge (http://datachallenge.ischool.umd.edu/datasets/)
